STEALTH OPERATOR SERVICE (SOS) is an IRC operator service for ircu2.10.11 
written in C++ for Linux/UNIX platforms. It is not part of a greater package and
it does not require any sort of SQL database in order to run; it simply uses
files to store data.

The official distribution site for SOS is located at:
	http://stealth.ircplanet.net/

Should you have any questions, concerns, suggestions, or any sort of other
feedback, send them via e-mail to stealth@ircplanet.net. Do not send flames
if you expect any sort of reply--if you'd like to flame, do it objectively
and rationally. And please do not send e-mails in HTML, because HTML e-mail
just is not a good idea. :)
