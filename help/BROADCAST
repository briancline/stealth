HELP on BROADCAST                            Level %L

  Syntax: /msg %N broadcast <message to broadcast>

 Example: /msg %N broadcast Over the next few minutes we will be rerouting a few servers, so there will be a few splits but will return shortly. Thank you for your patience.

   Usage: Sends a broadcast notice to every client connected to the network.
          Ideal for sending messages about planned services outages or major
          rerouting that may cause several splits.
