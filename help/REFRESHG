HELP on REFRESHG                            Level %L

  Syntax: /msg %N refreshg

 Example: /msg %N refreshg

   Usage: Resends all g-lines to the network. Ideal if your network does
          not have g-line synchronization during bursts and a new server
          does not know about effective g-lines.
